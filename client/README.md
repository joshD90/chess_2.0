# chess_2.0
A redo of the mechanics of chess in typescript with no framework to practice Jest, classes and Typescript

This project will simply work from a html base, will not work with sockets.

With this project I hope to work with much cleaner coding practices, boost my skills and familiarity with testing.

I also want to make sure that I fully modularise and break down my logic in line with cleaner code practices.  This will be tested with Jest
